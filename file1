ABD (born 17 February, 1984) is a South African international cricketer, who plays all formats and also a former captain in all formats. He has been rated as the number one batsman in Tests and ODIs on several occasions.[1][2] Often regarded as one of the best batsmen of his generation and also regarded as one of the greatest of all time,[3] De Villiers holds many batting records, including the world's fastest ODI 50, 100 and 150, the fastest Test century by a South African and the fastest T20I 50 by a South African. AB de Villiers is also among one of the marquee players in T20 Global League.

ABD began his international career as a wicketkeeper-batsman (returning to the role 4 a few years in mid-career), but has played most often solely as a batsman. He has batted at various positions in the batting order but predominantly in the middle-order. Noted as one of the most innovative batsmen in the modern game, De Villiers is noted for many unorthodox shots behind the wicket-keeper and slips, which earned him the nickname Mr. 360. He made his international debut in a Test match against England in 2004 and first played an ODI in early 2005. His debut in Twenty20 International cricket came in 2006. As of 2016, he has passed 8,000 runs in both Test and ODI cricket and has a batting average of over fifty in both forms of the game.
